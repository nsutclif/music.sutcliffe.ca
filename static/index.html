        <p>The whole school is planning a SECRET surprise for the teachers on our last day of school.  Weâ€™re going to give them the gift of this song.  Please practice singing the words at home so you know them, but do NOT sing them for your teacher until the Awards Assembly on the last day of school!</p>
        <p>We are learning sign language as well.  If you are in Music class, Mrs. Schultz will teach you these.  If not, she will try to sneak in during lunchtime to teach them to your class, or you can ask a sibling or friend who knows them to show you.</p>
        <p>Below are videos and lyrics to assist students practice at home.</p>
